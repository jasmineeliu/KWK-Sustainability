Out of all the Earth's water, only 3% is fresh, and of that, a significant 2.5% is locked away in glaciers and polar ice caps making it inaccessible. This leaves just 0.5% of the planet‚Äôs water readily available to meet the needs of a growing global population alongside the rising demands from agriculture and industry. When the demand for freshwater surpasses the available supply needed to meet both human and ecological needs, we experience water stress. According to the UN-Water program, in 2021, approximately 10% of the global population - 720 million people - lived in countries with high and critical water stress levels.",
