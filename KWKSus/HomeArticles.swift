                    description: "There are high hopes that artificial intelligence (AI) can help tackle some of the world‚Äôs biggest environmental emergencies. Among other things, the technology is already being used to map the destructive dredging of sand and chart emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. But when it comes to the environment, there is a negative side to the explosion of AI and its associated infrastructure, according to a growing body of research.",

                    description: "We can't manage what we don't measure, goes the old business adage. This rings true more than ever today as the world faces a triple planetary crisis of climate change, nature and biodiversity loss, pollution, and waste. More climate data is available than ever before, but how that data is accessed, interpreted and acted on is crucial to managing these crises. One technology that is central to this is Artificial Intelligence (AI).",
